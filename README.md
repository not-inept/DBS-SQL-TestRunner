To run:
1. Please create a testRunner.config file (copy the template and change the "name" varialble to one that is yet to be used, then make a PR to add your results). 
2. Create a folder ./res/<name> corresponding to your name.
3. Run `python testRunner.py`.

Notes: 
* /res/mason #8 does not show teams for years where there weren't any WS winners.
* /res/mason #9,#10 use stats.teams as per the piazza post (instead of homegames)
