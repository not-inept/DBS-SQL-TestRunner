To run, please create a testRunner.config file (copy the template and change the "name" varialbe to one that is yet to be used, then make a PR to add your results)

Then just do `python testRunner.py`.

Notes: 
* /res/mason #8 does not show teams for years where there weren't any WS winners.
* /res/mason #9,#10 use stats.teams as per the piazza post (instead of homegames)
